# UPC-s-and-the-Ebay-API-for-a-Million-Dollar-Heist
Ebay is not that different from the stock market, other than the fact that there's way less money on Ebay but way more unique prices. Because of this, Ebay is ripe for a high frequency trading, flash crash like moment that the stock market had years ago. The vulnerable Ebay sellers are not mom and pop online storefronts, but rather large, algorithmic, automated marketplaces that dont have enough revenue to do much more than average the price of whatever Ebay.com says is a similar product. My code will let you download and scrape all the relevant information from a million Ebay products per week using a laptop and wifi, including, most importantly, the UPC codes that can allow you to systematically tank the prices of automated sellers. Below is a gif showing a million products and timestamps and a ton of information:

At the end of the python file you'll find code for how I transformed the data. Basically, for any product where I could find 5+ good examples of a fair price, I would track the product and look out for any new listings of that same UPC code that were a much lower price. I would get a hit pretty rarely but when it did hit it's free money. The Ebay API allows you to automatically buy and sell products, so using this method, I think I could steal a million dollars. Not too interested in doing that this project was just for fun...
