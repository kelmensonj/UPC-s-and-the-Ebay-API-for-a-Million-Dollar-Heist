# UPC-s-and-the-Ebay-API-for-a-Million-Dollar-Heist
This was my first major foray into python. It's a parallelized web scraper with an auto saving database. I managed to make it go pretty fast, grabbing a combination of data using the Ebay API directly, as well as some basic html scraping for the UPC codes. These UPC codes are very valuable - there are databases online that can cost thousands of dollars over time but this is a pretty good way around that. I managed to identify the product, price range, and UPC code for around 10,000 products. I think I could build this database up to the same size as any other online database using code pretty similar to this. Below is a gif of the file where I saved all the product data:
